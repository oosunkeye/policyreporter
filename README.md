A React application built with Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS that calculates the remainder (modulo three) of a binary string using a Finite State Machine (FSM). The app features a responsive, full-screen UI with a dynamic greeting ("Good morning", "Good afternoon", or "Good evening") based on the time of day, input validation, and a test results table displayed after valid input.

## Features
- **Modulo Three Calculation**: Computes the remainder when a binary string (e.g., "1101") is divided by 3.
- **Dynamic Greeting**: Displays "Greetings - Good morning", "Good afternoon", or "Good evening" based on local time.
- **Responsive Design**: Full-screen layout with Tailwind CSS, adapting to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- **Input Validation**: Throws an error for non-binary inputs (e.g., "abc").
- **Test Table**: Shows predefined test cases after a valid input, with black text and colored status (green for "PASSED", red for "FAILED").

## Tech Stack
- **React**: Frontend library for building the UI.
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for the FSM and time-based greeting.
